(For termux dm me on discord you would need a pre-prepare script for this to work)
# Spotify API
So for Spotify Api, Go on https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/, log to your account, create a new application, go on your application setting, copy client id then click on view client secret and copy it
There you go







# How Does it work
- first you would need stats.fm plus, sorry for those who do not have it will not be possible
- Launch cmd in the Stats.fm folder on your computer, write python Stats.fm.py and it Enter
- Enter the song name, the artiste name, the album name etc etc, and when you finished it enter
- You got your .json file in the same folder, go on https://stats.fm/import, put the file you just created and the refresh until its good
- Now you have fake data in your profile
